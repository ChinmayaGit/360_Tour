      <div class="title">China's Forgotten War</div>
      <div class="text">WWII came to the small town of Tai’erzhuang in central China – and it was never the same again. The town was strategically placed, on the north-south transport railway corridor and the ancient Grand Canal, and so was a focus of the Japanese Imperial army as it advanced.
